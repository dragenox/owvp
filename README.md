# Open Web Video Player (owvp)
Open Web Video Player is a project I created mainly for ChromeOS, as it lacks a light weight video player that supports srt and playlists. You could install one from the android but that defeats the purpose of ChromeOS being a web first OS. I am a kind of a native purist. ✌🏽😅
